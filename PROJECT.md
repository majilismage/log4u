# Travel Log Project Status

## To Do Next
- Change naming of Drive directory structure
- Show state in UI
- Add media link to Google Sheet
- Add error toast notifications for better user feedback

- Implement proper error handling for file upload failures

## Completed Features

### Core Application
- Next.js 15.2.4 application with TypeScript
- Modern UI using Tailwind CSS and Radix UI components
- Three main tabs: New Entry, Gallery, and History
- Accessible modal dialogs with proper ARIA labels and descriptions

### Form Implementation
- Basic travel log entry form with:
  - Departure and Arrival dates
  - Location details (town, country, latitude, longitude) for both departure and arrival
  - Distance, Average Speed, and Max Speed inputs
  - Notes field
  - Image upload with preview functionality
  - Ability to remove selected files before upload
  - Progress tracking during file upload

### Media Management
- File preview grid with hover-to-remove functionality
- Support for multiple file selection
- Delayed upload until form submission
- Progress tracking during upload
- Proper error handling and logging
- Organized file storage in Google Drive

### Google Sheets Integration
- Service account authentication
- Automatic saving of entries to Google Sheets
- Extended data structure to include:
  - Departure/Arrival dates
  - Location details (town, country, coordinates)
  - Journey metrics (distance, speeds)
  - Timestamps for record keeping
  - Media links from Google Drive

## Planned Features

### Location Auto-Complete
- Integration with OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API
- Auto-complete suggestions for town/city names
- Automatic population of:
  - Country information
  - Latitude/Longitude coordinates
- Caching of API responses for performance

### Smart Form Population
- Auto-populate "From" location with previous entry's "To" location
- Clear button for manual override
- Maintain location data structure in form state
- Allow user overrides while keeping data integrity

### Rich Text Editor
- Ability to add text style and formatting
- Ability to add hyperlinks and horizontal dividers
- Blog post style formatting
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Block quotes

### Distance Analytics
- Add total distance traveled counter in UI
- Implement distance aggregation by:
  - Time periods (weekly, monthly, yearly)
  - Countries visited
  - Routes (global map of all routes, animated, TravelBoast (https://travelboast.com/#/) style)
- Add visual representation of distance metrics
- Calculate and display:
  - Average journey length
  - Average speed

## Technical Debt & Improvements
- Implement input validation for all form fields
- Improve error handling in Google Sheets integration
- Add retry mechanism for failed saves
- Implement proper type checking throughout the application
- Implement more sophisticated Google Drive security model:
  - Replace 'anyone with link' permissions with proper access control
  - Consider implementing domain-restricted access
  - Add file access auditing
  - Implement role-based access control for media files
- Add comprehensive error handling for network failures
- Implement file upload resume capability for large files
- Add file type validation and size limits
- Implement client-side image optimization before upload
