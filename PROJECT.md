# Travel Log Project Status

## To Do Next
- Show state in UI
- Add video link to Google Sheet
- Add error toast notifications for better user feedback
- Add loading states for individual form fields during API calls
- Implement proper error handling for file upload failures

## Completed Features

### Core Application
- Next.js 15.2.4 application with TypeScript
- Modern UI using Tailwind CSS and Radix UI components
- Three main tabs: New Entry, Gallery, and History
- Accessible modal dialogs with proper ARIA labels and descriptions

### Form Implementation
- Basic travel log entry form with:
  - Departure and Arrival dates
  - Location details (town, country, latitude, longitude) for both departure and arrival
  - Distance, Average Speed, and Max Speed inputs
  - Notes field
  - Image upload with preview functionality
  - Ability to remove selected files before upload
  - Progress tracking during file upload

### Media Management
- File preview grid with hover-to-remove functionality
- Support for multiple file selection
- Delayed upload until form submission
- Progress tracking during upload
- Enhanced Media Gallery:
  - Displays all media (images and videos) from Google Drive.
  - Responsive, lazy-loaded grid using direct thumbnail links for efficient loading.
  - Media grouped by journey, with journey ID headings.
  - Robust loading state indicator during initial media retrieval.
  - Filename overlay removed from thumbnails for a cleaner look.
- Proper error handling and logging
- Improved Google Drive folder structure management:
  - Singleton pattern for folder management to prevent duplicates
  - Promise-based caching to prevent race conditions
  - Atomic folder structure creation
  - Organized media files by type (images/videos) under journey folders
  - Consistent folder hierarchy: year/month/journeyId/(images|videos)/filename
  - Thread-safe folder operations
  - Comprehensive logging and error tracking
- Organized file storage in Google Drive with structured directory naming
- Secure file naming with location, date, and hash components

### Google Sheets Integration
- Service account authentication
- Automatic saving of entries to Google Sheets
- Extended data structure to include:
  - Departure/Arrival dates
  - Location details (town, country, coordinates)
  - Journey metrics (distance, speeds)
  - Timestamps for record keeping
- Media folder links (images for now) from Google Drive are reliably saved to Google Sheets with each record

### History Page (Phase 1 Foundation)
- Fetches and displays journey history within the existing "History" tab.
- **Responsive Journey Cards:**
  - Each journey entry is displayed in a card with a responsive layout (two-column on desktop, single-column on mobile).
  - Dark mode support for all new history components.
- **Journey Metadata Display:**
  - Shows "From: {Town} ({Country}) -> To: {Town} ({Country})".
  - Displays formatted Departure and Arrival dates (e.g., "July 20, 2024").
  - Shows Distance, Average Speed, and Max Speed with icons.
  - Uses icons for locations, dates, and travel stats, matching the desired modern UI.
- **Journey Content Display:**
  - Displays journey notes within the card.
- **Loading and States:**
  - Implements loading state with a spinner consistent with other app areas (e.g., Gallery).
  - Handles error states if data fetching fails.
  - Displays a "No history entries found" message when applicable.

## Planned Features

### Enhanced History View
- **Interactive Journey Display:**
  - Minimap plotting start/end points with a connecting arrow.
- **Supporting API Endpoints:**
  - API for updating notes in Google Sheets.
  - APIs for deleting and adding media to Google Drive and updating Google Sheets.
  - Refined `/api/history` to provide detailed data for each journey, including individual media item details.

### Location Auto-Complete
- Integration with OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API
- Auto-complete suggestions for town/city names
- Automatic population of:
  - Country information
  - Latitude/Longitude coordinates
- Caching of API responses for performance

### Smart Form Population
- Auto-populate "From" location with previous entry's "To" location
- Clear button for manual override
- Maintain location data structure in form state
- Allow user overrides while keeping data integrity

### Rich Text Editor
- Ability to add text style and formatting
- Ability to add hyperlinks and horizontal dividers
- Blog post style formatting
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Block quotes

### Distance Analytics
- Add total distance traveled counter in UI
- Implement distance aggregation by:
  - Time periods (weekly, monthly, yearly)
  - Countries visited
  - Routes (global map of all routes, animated, TravelBoast (https://travelboast.com/#/) style)
- Add visual representation of distance metrics
- Calculate and display:
  - Average journey length
  - Average speed

## Technical Debt & Improvements
- Implement input validation for all form fields
- Improve error handling in Google Sheets integration
- Add retry mechanism for failed saves
- Implement proper type checking throughout the application
- Implement more sophisticated Google Drive security model:
  - Replace 'anyone with link' permissions with proper access control
  - Consider implementing domain-restricted access
  - Add file access auditing
  - Implement role-based access control for media files
- Add comprehensive error handling for network failures
- Implement file upload resume capability for large files
- Add file type validation and size limits
- Implement client-side image optimization before upload
- Consider implementing folder structure cleanup for failed uploads
- Add periodic cache cleanup for the folder manager
- Implement folder structure validation and repair utilities
