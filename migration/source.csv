It all worked out in the end, first few nights were amazing, birthday day was incredible. Scooter ride to Ravello, amazing dinner at Gemma, a gem. Great dinner on the 14th from amazing restaurant with a view of Doublestar. Walked into Atrani. Thursday the weather turned and we had the 1:20 scooter ride for blood tests and ECG. Wonderful people at the clinic, 'Francesca' - 5' of smiles. Bad night, lots of swell, and then a lot of wind Friday. Leaving Saturday with cross wind was stressful, but the cash in had Giulio pushed with his dinghy and we were fine. ",,,,,,
